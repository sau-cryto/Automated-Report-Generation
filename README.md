8. Future Improvements

üîπ Integration with Machine Learning for predictive insights.
üîπ Real-Time Reporting using streaming data sources.
üîπ Cloud-Based Reporting System for better accessibility.
üîπ Interactive Dashboards instead of static reports.
üîπ Multi-User Access with authentication and role-based report access.



9. Key Insights

Automating reports saves significant time in business operations.

Using scheduled execution ensures reports are generated on time without manual intervention.

Combining multiple formats (PDF, Excel, HTML) improves flexibility in data presentation.

Email integration allows for easy sharing of reports with stakeholders.

Visualization (graphs and charts) makes reports more insightful.



10. Code Explanation

Step 1: Data Collection

The script reads data from CSV, database, or API.

pandas is used to load and preprocess data.


import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")



Step 2: Data Processing and Visualization

Missing values are handled, and charts are created.


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Data cleaning
data.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Create a bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.barplot(x="Product", y="Revenue", data=data)
plt.savefig("sales_chart.png")  # Save chart



Step 3: Report Generation

A. PDF Report (Using reportlab)

Creates a PDF report with text and an image.


from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

pdf_file = "sales_report.pdf"
c = canvas.Canvas(pdf_file, pagesize=letter)
c.drawString(100, 750, "Sales Report - Monthly Summary")
c.drawImage("sales_chart.png", 100, 600, width=400, height=200)  # Add chart
c.save()

B. Excel Report (Using xlsxwriter)

Writes processed data into an Excel file.


import xlsxwriter

workbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook("sales_report.xlsx")
worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet()

# Write headers
headers = ["Product", "Revenue"]
for col, header in enumerate(headers):
    worksheet.write(0, col, header)

# Write data
for row, record in enumerate(data.itertuples(), start=1):
    worksheet.write(row, 0, record.Product)
    worksheet.write(row, 1, record.Revenue)

workbook.close()

C. HTML Report (Using Jinja2)

Generates a dynamic HTML report.


from jinja2 import Template

html_template = """
<html>
<head><title>Sales Report</title></head>
<body>
    <h2>Sales Report</h2>
    <img src="sales_chart.png">
    <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Product</th><th>Revenue</th></tr>
        {% for row in data %}
        <tr><td>{{ row.Product }}</td><td>{{ row.Revenue }}</td></tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
</body>
</html>
"""

template = Template(html_template)
html_content = template.render(data=data.to_dict(orient="records"))

with open("sales_report.html", "w") as file:
    file.write(html_content)


---

Step 4: Automating the Report Generation

The script is scheduled using cron jobs or Task Scheduler.


Example cron job to run daily at midnight:

0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/report_script.py


---

Step 5: Sending Reports via Email

The generated reports (PDF, Excel, HTML) are emailed automatically.


import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email import encoders

email_user = "your_email@example.com"
email_pass = "your_password"
email_send = "recipient@example.com"

msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg["From"] = email_user
msg["To"] = email_send
msg["Subject"] = "Automated Sales Report"

# Attach PDF
filename = "sales_report.pdf"
attachment = open(filename, "rb")
part = MIMEBase("application", "octet-stream")
part.set_payload(attachment.read())
encoders.encode_base64(part)
part.add_header("Content-Disposition", f"attachment; filename={filename}")
msg.attach(part)

# Send email
server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587)
server.starttls()
server.login(email_user, email_pass)
server.sendmail(email_user, email_send, msg.as_string())
server.quit()
